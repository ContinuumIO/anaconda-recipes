  summary: Low-level library to perform the matrix building step in CVXPY
  description: |
    Convex optimization modeling tools like CVX, CVXPY, and Convex.Jl translate
    high-level problem descriptions into low-level, canonical forms that are
    then passed to an backend solver. CVXcanon is a software package that
    factors out the common operations that all such modeling systems perform
    into a single library with a simple C++ interface.
