  summary: A library for deferring decorator actions
  description: |
    Venusian is a library which allows framework authors to defer decorator
    actions. Instead of taking actions when a function (or class) decorator
    is executed at import time, you can defer the action usually taken by the
    decorator until a separate "scan" phase.
