  summary: Task scheduling and blocked algorithms for parallel processing
  description: |
    Dask is a simple task scheduling system that uses directed acylcic graphs
    (DAGS) of tasks to break up large computations into many small ones. Dask
    enables parallel computing through task scheduling and blocked algorithms.
    This allows developers to write complex parallel algorithms and execute
    them in parallel either on a modern multi-core machine or on a distributed
    cluster.
