  summary: Traits-capable windowing framework
  description: |
    The TraitsUI project contains a toolkit-independent GUI abstraction layer,
    which is used to support the "visualization" features of the Traits
    package. Thus, you can write model in terms of the Traits API and specify
    a GUI in terms of the primitives supplied by TraitsUI (views, items,
    editors, etc.), and let TraitsUI and your selected toolkit and back-end
    take care of the details of displaying them.
