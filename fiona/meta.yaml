  summary: OGR's neat, nimble, no-nonsense API for Python programmers
  description: |
    Fiona is designed to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading and
    writing data in standard Python IO style and relies upon familiar Python
    types and protocols such as files, dictionaries, mappings, and iterators
    instead of classes specific to OGR.  Fiona can read and write real-world
    data using multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file systems and
    integrates readily with other Python GIS packages such as pyproj, Rtree,
    and Shapely.
