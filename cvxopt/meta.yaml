  summary: Library for convex optimization
  description: |
    CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on Python.
    It can be used with the interactive Python interpreter, on the command line
    by executing Python scripts, or integrated in other software via Python
    extension modules. Its main purpose is to make the development of software
    for convex optimization applications straightforward by building on Python's
    extensive standard library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level
    programming language.
