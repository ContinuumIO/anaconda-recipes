  summary: general purpose programming language
  description: |
    Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic
    programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
    readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in
    fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or
    Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs
    on both a small and large scale.
