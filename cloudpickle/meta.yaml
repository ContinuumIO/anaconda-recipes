  summary: Extended pickling support for Python objects
  description: |
    Cloudpickle makes it possible to serialize Python constructs not supported
    by the default pickle module from the Python standard library.
    Cloudpickle is especially useful for cluster computing where Python
    expressions are shipped over the network to execute on remote hosts,
    possibly close to the data.
