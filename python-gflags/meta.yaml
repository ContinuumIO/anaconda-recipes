  summary: the Python equivalent of gflags
  description: |
    Python-gflags is a Python implementation of the Google commandline flags
    module. gflags defines a distributed command line system, replacing systems
    like getopt(), optparse and manual argument processing. Rather than an
    application having to define all flags in or near main(), each Python
    module defines flags that are useful to it. When one python module imports
    another, it gains access to the other's flags.
