**This repository is deprecated.**

Recipes used in the free 
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) are hosted 
in the Anaconda, Inc managed 
[AnacondaRecipes/aggregate](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/aggregate)
repository. 

This repository holds recipes used in older versions of the distribution.
The old README.md file for the repository has been renamed to [README_OLD.md](README_OLD.md).

The feedstocks in the 
[AnacondaRecipes](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/) organization, 
are forked from <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge">conda-forge</a>,
a community-driven recipe repo.
Conda-forge is used as a reference for updating and fixing recipes in defaults.
Community users encouraged to submit PRs to the conda-forge feedstock and then submit a PR to
the AnacondaRecipes feedstock, showing that your changes work.

Direct submissions of PRs to the feedstocks in the
[AnacondaRecipes](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/) organization are also
acceptable.  We will incorporate mutually agreed upon changes as time allows
and upstream them to conda-forge.
