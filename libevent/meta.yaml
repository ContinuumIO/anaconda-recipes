  summary: Library for asynchronous event notification
  description: |
    The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when
    a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been
    reached. Furthermore, libevent also supports callbacks due to signals or
    regular timeouts.
