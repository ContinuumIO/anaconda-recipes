  summary: Basic astronomical computations for Python
  description: |
    PyEphem provides basic astronomical computations for the Python programming
    language. Given a date and location on the Earth's surface, it can compute
    the positions of the Sun and Moon, of the planets and their moons, and of
    any asteroids, comets, or earth satellites whose orbital elements the user
    can provide.
