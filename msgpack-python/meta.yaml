  summary: An efficient binary serialization format
  description: |
    MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you
    exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and
    smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical
    short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings
    themselves.
