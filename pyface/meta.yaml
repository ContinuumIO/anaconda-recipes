  summary: Traits-capable windowing framework
  description: |
    The pyface project contains a toolkit-independent GUI abstraction layer,
    which is used to support the "visualization" features of the Traits
    package. Thus, you can write code in terms of the Traits API (views,
    items, editors, etc.), and let pyface and your selected toolkit and
    back-end take care of the details of displaying them.
