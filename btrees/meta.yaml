  summary: scalable persistent object containers
  description: |
    BTrees contains a set of persistent object containers built around a
    modified BTree data structure. The trees are optimized for use inside
    ZODB's "optimistic currency" paradigm, and include explicit resolution of
    conflicts detected by that mechanism.
