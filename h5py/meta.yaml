  summary: Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format
  description: |
    The h5py package is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format.
    It lets you store huge amounts of numerical data, and easily manipulate
    that data from NumPy. For example, you can slice into multi-terabyte
    datasets stored on disk, as if they were real NumPy arrays. Thousands of
    datasets can be stored in a single file, categorized and tagged however
    you want.
