  summary: Replacement for Python lists with better performance
  description: |
    Blist is a drop-in replacement for the Python list that provides
    better performance for large lists and virtually identical performance for
    small lists. The blist uses a flexible, hybrid array/tree structure to
    minimize the number of items in memory that are moved. The blist package
    also provides sortedlist, sortedset, weaksortedlist, weaksortedset,
    sorteddict, and btuple.
